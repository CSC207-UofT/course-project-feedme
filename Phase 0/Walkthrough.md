## Scenario Walk-through
Feed Me app starts with a login/signup page, it requires user to 
log in on their account for Usermanager to identify its user type, 
to direct the user into the different interface(customer, restaurant and
courier) / user that has not register in our program would require to make 
a new account using their phone number and have their own password. 
As a customer has successful login, the user is able to view all the 
restaurants that stores in Usermanager. Now, after the customer has chosen 
their favourites restaurant, all the products that are available in the 
restaurant would be shown, the products are editable by the restaurant 
from Productmanager . Customer can select the products they want to order, 
this part would pass to Ordermanager. Ordermanager generates a new order 
that is viewable/acceptable for restaurant users and notifies the courier 
there is available order to deliver. As the order is complete, each of 
the user types can see their completed orders.
