# Accessibility Report

## Principle 1: Equitable Use
Our program can be used by any kind of users, such as restaurant owners, delivery persons and customers. All the 
users can use the functions in an equivalent manner, especially at the beginning of operation (such as signing up 
and log-in interfaces). After that, the functions will then differ according to the required operation of the users. 
As for the privacy and security part, each user will have their own username (phone number) and password to log in. 
Users will be allowed to access the following functions only after they enter the right username and password at the 
same time. Thus, the privacy of each user has been protected equally. Besides, the interface of our design is easy 
to understand and operate. The function is also relatively various. Thus, it can be referred to as an appealing 
design to the users.

Our program does not have a text-to-voice feature, therefore, cannot be used by blind people. In addition, since we 
don’t have a GUI, our software is not friendly to people who has a vision problem. Thus, our program does not fully 
apply to equitable use principle, which can be improved in the future.

## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
We are the program that can provide three interfaces for different user types. Customers can have their choice of 
restaurant and food. The restaurant can choose to edit the menu, receive orders, and review order history. The 
courier is also free to choose the delivered items, to view and update order information. each user will have their 
own experience by using our program.

The way we designed our selection input facilitates accuracy and precision because users do not need to type out the 
full name of the restaurant or product, but simply input a number. In addition, the instruction of our software does 
not require high-level reading comprehension. Unfortunately, our software does not have a GUI, therefore the size, 
font, colour, and contrast of the test cannot be adjusted, which can be further improved in the future.

## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
We provide detailed instructions for each step, and it accommodates as many people as possible. We replace some 
complex keyword inputting with some rough numbers, which also fit the intuition of the users. The order of options 
has also been arranged according to their importance. We offer the wrong message when something goes wrong, and each 
correct action will have praise following.

Instead of asking the customer to type out the full name of the restaurant and the product, we number the 
restaurants and products, so the customer and simply input the number. This applies to the simple use principle.

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information
We do not have perceptible facilitation because we use the command line for this program.  We do not have many 
pictures or physical inputting techniques.

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
We have arranged our code in the most preferred way that a user can utilize it. For example, we will always list the 
most common and reachable option in the beginning for a user interface. In that ordering manner, the error can be 
minimized in an efficient way. In addition, we offered the option “quit” to return to the last level. And after the 
return, we also provide the quit message for that operation. In that case, the harm of an incautious action can be 
minimized.

## Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
We have already simplified the process of using our program. For instance, a user can get to the function simply by 
entering the number. In our restaurant system controller, if a restaurant owner wants to change the information of a 
product. He can just type the key “1” to edit the product name, “2” to edit the product stock and “3” to edit the 
product price according to the interface. Instead of typing the action, this design can efficiently save users time 
and effort.

## Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
The format of the command line will have adequate space for the accessory. And for each instruction, we only have 
1~2 sentences at most, which almost can be accommodated for any user, regardless of their accessibility.

- The most marketable area would be various kinds of restaurants since they are the origin of all business cycles. 
  Restaurants need programs to designate orders to the delivery person, and display menus to attract customers. By 
  using our program, restaurant owners can optimize their profits instead of selling offline. Online food delivery 
  indicates more opportunities. Besides, customers will also need our program to access more types of restaurants 
  and kinds of food. The delivery person can use our program as a platform for working.

- Our program will be less likely to be used by people who do not enjoy shopping online. Since some old fashion 
  people would think food bought online is unreliable and unsafe.
