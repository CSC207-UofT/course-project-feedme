# Specification
This software is a food delivery system that allows users to browse and order food in the local restaurants. While 
using this system, users can choose whether they are a customer, restaurant owner, or a delivery person. Then, each 
user will be assigned to a specific type based on their selection (i.e. 'c' for customer, 'r' for restaurant, and 
'd' for delivery person). Users login to this system with their phone number. While logging in, the system will check
their user type and direct them to different interfaces.

There are three interfaces in this system: customer, restaurant owner, and delivery person that all share an order 
tracking feature, and they can all use the ordering system to edit order status. In the customer interface, users 
can view a list of all restaurants and their menus. In addition, users can order items through the ordering system. 
In the restaurant owner interface, users can edit their menus, view their order history and distribute their orders 
through the restaurant system. In the deliveryPerson interface, users can confirm delivery requests and confirm 
orders are delivered through the ordering system.
